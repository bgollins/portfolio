            <p>Originally raised in the <em>Blue Ridge Mountains</em> of Western North Carolina, I've lived in New York City for the past four years. Fortunately for me,  I recently relocated to <span style="color:pink">Portland, OR</span> in July. I enjoy outdoor activities like backpacking, hiking, climbing, cycling, and running. My artsy side lends itself to:
              <ul>
                <li>sewing</li>
                <li>playing ukulele</li>
                <li>singing</li>
                <li>card making.</li></p>
              </ul>
            <p>I think that since we spend most of our waking hours at our jobs, <strong>they should be enjoyable and fulfilling</strong>. My goal is to use my affinity for technology as well as my facilitation, training, and coaching skills to help friends and colleagues to challenge themselves personally and professionally, pursue their passions, and end up a few steps closer to reaching their goals.</p>
